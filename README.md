# Mobile Phone Specifications - SQL Data Cleaning Project

This project showcases a complete data cleaning and transformation pipeline executed entirely in MySQL. It takes a raw, semi-structured CSV file containing mobile phone specifications and processes it into a clean, well-structured, and analysis-ready table.

The script demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for parsing, standardizing, and structuring data, making it a valuable asset for any data analytics or business intelligence task. ðŸ“ˆ

## Key Techniques Used

The entire cleaning process is encapsulated in a single, idempotent SQL script that leverages modern MySQL 8+ features:

* **Regular Expressions (`REGEXP_SUBSTR`, `REGEXP_REPLACE`):** Heavily used to extract specific data points (like RAM, chipset, battery capacity) from unstructured text fields.
* **Advanced String Manipulation (`SUBSTRING_INDEX`, `LOCATE`):** Employed to split combined fields into their constituent parts, such as separating performance, display, and camera specs.
* **Conditional Logic (`CASE` Statements):** Used extensively to handle variations in data, standardize units (e.g., converting MHz to GHz, MB to GB), and categorize features (e.g., determining resolution category from pixel height).
* **Structured Workflow:** The script follows a logical flow, using temporary staging columns (e.g., `cores`, `resolution_in_px`) to hold intermediate values, which are then processed and dropped during a final cleanup phase.
* **Data Validation:** Concludes with final verification and a data quality summary to provide a quantitative overview of the cleaned dataset's completeness.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script

To replicate the data cleaning process, follow these steps:

1.  **Setup Database:** Create a new MySQL database.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS 91_mobiles;
    USE 91_mobiles;
    ```
2.  **Enable Local File Loading:** Ensure `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` is enabled on your MySQL server, as this is required to import the CSV.
3.  **Update File Path:** Open the `mobile_specs_cleaning.sql` script and update the file path in the `LOAD DATA` command to point to the location of your raw CSV file.
    ```sql
    -- Update this line in the script
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/path/to/your/91_mobiles_uncleaned.csv'
    ```
4.  **Execute Script:** Run the entire `mobile_specs_cleaning.sql` script from top to bottom. The script is designed to be re-runnable without errors.
